    <li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/" target="_blank">Real TechCrunch.com</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The idea that I got behind starting this project as a way to practice my HTML and CSS skills further got simple from googling "best blog websites to practice html and css" and I think I remember that this website got recommended first.
    Fact is the Project is uploaded to GitHub but it's not yet complete finished.
    I hope to return one day to finish the project.
    Main purpose of this project is like I said to expand my knowledge and practice of Web Development.
