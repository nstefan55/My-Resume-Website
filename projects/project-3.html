    This is my most recent project I made utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript combined with GSAP Plugin for animations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea behind the project was to create a modern looking website that has really cool animations and design and actually I'm pretty proud of myself because it took me a bit some time to create this project and I'm really satisified how it turned out.
