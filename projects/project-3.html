        This is my most recent project I made utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript
        combined with GSAP Plugin for animations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea behind the project was to create a modern looking website that
        has really cool animations and design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Actually I'm pretty happy how the initial idea and now a complete
        project turned out as a nice looking gym niche template website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe in the future I'll come back to add more features to the page.

        As I'm going through my jourey of becoming a software dev, Im starting
        to implement more JavaScript into my projects so they actually start
        being interactive.
      </p>

      <p>
        My next big planned projects are gonna be focused on even more on
        JavaScript.
