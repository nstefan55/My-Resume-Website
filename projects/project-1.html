      <p>
        This is my most recent project I made utilizing HTML5, CSS3 and
        JavaScript combined with a JavaScript external library for animations
        GSAP, entirely responsive website. Entire codebase is uploaded to GitHub
        with link above
      </p>
      <p>
        The core idea behind the project was to create a modern looking website
        that has really professional design and dynamic animations.
      </p>

      <p>Project took 2 weeks to finish.</p>
